# U-Net-Water-Land-Segmentation

Final project using the U-Net for water/land segmentation. Using the video frames from a automated guided veichle (AGV) on water and the [WAsR](https://github.com/lojzezust/WaSR) algorithm we get the initial dataset, which we then use to train the U-Net on it to binary classify/segment water/other regions using the 80/20 split with consecutive frames.
